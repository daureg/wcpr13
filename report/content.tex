\section{Introduction}
Describe the data, the problem and related one (sentiment analysis), the
previous works\cite{mairesse2007perso}, the method that will be used.

\section{Pre processing}
How essays.csv was turn into a feature matrix. May include
\begin{itemize}
\item encoding issue
\item word counting
\item number handling
\item stemming/lemmatization using \autocite{bird2009nltk} (I also consider
	using a CRF implementation \autocite[for instance][]{CRFsuite} but it
	require too much training for my goal).
\item textual marker (case, punctuation, length)
\item POS tagging
\item Entity recognition
\end{itemize}

\section{Classification}
Dimensionality reduction: SVD, LDA, ICA

Method: MN NB, RBF C-SVM (maybe with text kernel?), cosine kNN
