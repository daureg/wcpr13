Well
,
right
now
I
just
woke
up
from
a
mid-day
nap
.
It
's
sort
of
weird
,
but
ever
since
I
moved
to
Texas
,
I
have
had
problems
concentrating
on
things
.
I
remember
starting
my
homework
in
1
th
grade
as
soon
as
the
clock
struck
1
and
not
stopping
until
it
was
done
.
Of
course
it
was
easier
,
but
I
still
did
it
.
But
when
I
moved
here
,
the
homework
got
a
little
more
challenging
and
there
was
a
lot
more
busy
work
,
and
so
I
decided
not
to
spend
hours
doing
it
,
and
just
getting
by
.
But
the
thing
was
that
I
always
paid
attention
in
class
and
just
plain
out
knew
the
stuff
,
and
now
that
I
look
back
,
if
I
had
really
worked
hard
and
stayed
on
track
the
last
two
years
without
getting
lazy
,
I
would
have
been
a
genius
,
but
hey
,
that
's
all
good
.
It
's
too
late
to
correct
the
past
,
but
I
do
n't
really
know
how
to
stay
focused
n
the
future
.
The
one
thing
I
know
is
that
when
people
say
that
b/c
they
live
on
campus
they
ca
n't
concentrate
,
it
's
b.
s.
For
me
it
would
be
easier
there
,
but
alas
,
I
'm
living
at
home
under
the
watchful
eye
of
my
parents
and
a
little
nagging
sister
that
just
nags
and
nags
and
nags
.
You
get
my
point
.
Another
thing
is
,
is
that
it
's
just
a
hassle
to
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
school
to
just
to
go
to
library
to
study
.
I
need
to
move
out
,
but
I
do
n't
know
how
to
tell
them
.
Do
n't
get
me
wrong
,
I
see
where
they
're
coming
from
and
why
they
do
n't
want
me
to
move
out
,
but
I
need
to
get
away
and
be
on
my
own
.
They
've
sheltered
me
so
much
and
I
do
n't
have
a
worry
in
the
world
.
The
only
thing
that
they
ask
me
to
do
is
keep
my
room
clean
and
help
out
with
the
business
once
in
a
while
,
but
I
ca
n't
even
do
that
.
But
I
need
to
.
But
I
got
enough
money
from
UT
to
live
at
a
dorm
or
apartment
next
semester
and
I
think
I
'll
take
advantage
of
that
.
But
off
that
topic
now
,
I
went
to
sixth
street
last
night
and
had
a
blast
.
I
have
n't
been
there
in
so
long
.
Now
I
know
why
I
love
Austin
so
much
.
When
I
lived
in
VA
,
I
used
to
go
up
to
DC
all
the
time
and
had
a
blast
,
but
here
,
there
are
so
many
students
running
around
at
night
.
I
just
want
to
have
some
fun
and
I
know
that
I
am
responsible
enough
to
be
able
to
have
fun
,
but
keep
my
priorities
straight
.
Living
at
home
,
I
ca
n't
go
out
at
all
without
them
asking
where
?
with
who
?
why
?
when
are
you
coming
back
?
and
all
those
questions
.
I
just
wish
I
could
be
treated
like
a
responsible
person
for
once
,
but
my
sister
screwed
that
up
for
me
.
She
went
crazy
the
second
she
moved
into
college
and
messed
up
her
whole
college
career
by
partying
too
much
.
And
that
's
the
ultimate
reason
that
they
do
n't
want
me
to
go
and
have
fun
.
But
I
'm
not
little
anymore
,
and
they
need
to
let
me
go
and
explore
the
world
,
but
I
'm
Indian
;
with
Indian
culture
,
with
Indian
values
.
They
go
against
``
''
having
fun
.
``
``
I
mean
in
the
sense
of
meeting
people
or
going
out
with
people
or
partying
or
just
plain
having
fun
.
My
school
is
difficult
already
,
but
somehow
I
think
that
having
more
freedom
will
put
more
pressure
on
me
to
do
better
in
school
b/c
that
's
what
my
parents
and
ultimately
I
expect
of
myself
.
Well
it
's
been
fun
writing
,
I
do
n't
know
if
you
go
anything
out
of
this
writing
,
but
it
helped
me
get
some
of
my
thoughts
into
order
.
So
I
hope
you
had
fun
reading
it
and
good
luck
TA
's
.
